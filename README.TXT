These scripts are used to run the GBS Discovery Pipeline. They have been modified (through 06_01) to
run on AgResearch systems. Not all functionality is currently working. Two additional scripts
keyfile_to_subsetting_list.sh and subset.sh have been included as well. Those are used to pull subsets
of the data out of the hapmap files for distribution.
